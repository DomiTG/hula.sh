# Introduction
Avionify is a project started by me (**Dominik**). After loving flight simulators, I thought about coding something new, something good for flight simulators, something that would approach a lot of people around the world. I first came with idea named Aviationify which was just a pilot's career application. After failure, where I did gather some experience and another guy that would code with me we started Avionify.

We came with an idea! Another career app but users of the app manage their own airlines and they hire another users of the app.

# Techstack
We've decided to write Frot-end as well Backend in **TypeScript**. On the Backend we use **Express** for API routes, **WebSocket** for Live Communication between the app and server and clasic **MySQL** for data saving.

On the Front-end we use **Electron** with **React**, styling is done with **TailwindCSS**.
