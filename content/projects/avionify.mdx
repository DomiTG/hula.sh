# Introduction
Avionify is a project started by me (**Dominik**). After loving flight simulators, I thought about coding something new, something good for flight simulators, something that would approach a lot of people around the world. I first came with idea named Aviationify which was just a pilot's career application. After failure, where I did gather some experience and another guy that would code with me we started Avionify.

We came with an idea! Another career app but users of the app manage their own airlines and they hire another users of the app.

# What exactly is Avionify?
Did you ever dreamt of being a manager of your own airline? Or did you just want to be a pilot for any airline? Avionify is exactly for you. You can be both, pilot and manager. On Avionify to start your own company and airline you have to be **level 10** and have a **PREMIUM** account. You have to work your way up, to start an airline, which we think is a cool feature. In pilot career you have to level up in level, be promoted, get more money and obviously don't crash the plane. Once you get on **level 10** you will be able to create a company with airline, but it is not free! You have to pay your app money to get one.

# Techstack
We've decided to write Frot-end as well Backend in **TypeScript**. On the Backend we use **Express** for API routes, **WebSocket** for Live Communication between the app and server and clasic **MySQL** for data saving.

On the Front-end we use **Electron** with **React**, styling is done with **TailwindCSS**. Connection to simulators is done by **FSUIPC**, but we plan to create our own connector.

# Pricing
Avionify is **free to use**, but it has option of subscribing to the **Premium** plan, which gives you ability to create a company and use animated profile pictures.
